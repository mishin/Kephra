We are far away from our goal and standing nearly at the beginning so you can
track the evolve of something beautiful, enjoy. And if you like to join us,
your always welcome.

It is our goal to create an editor with a rich featureset that ease all your 
work as much as it makes sense. It is designed to be crossplatform, 
very configurable and extensible that it can fit perfectly to you and your tasks.
Knowing that this is nearly standart these days we also try to stay down to earth
and build this program with wisdom and love, that it can become a real universal
editor. But first will we serve ourselves and make it a good one for Perl and 
HTML.



                                                              Thanks




P.S. This file cannot be changed, this is considered by the developer as a feature.
